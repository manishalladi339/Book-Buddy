# Book-Buddy

BookBuddy is an online platform that allows users to explore, review, and recommend books. The application connects book lovers by providing an easy-to-use interface to share reviews, rate books, and discover new reads based on community recommendations. Built with React.js for the front-end, Node.js/Express for the back-end, and MongoDB for storing book data and user reviews, BookBuddy is an ideal project for showcasing your skills in full-stack web development and building engaging social platforms.

## Key Features:

Book Database: A catalog of books that can be searched by title, author, genre, and other filters.
Book Reviews: Users can submit reviews and rate books they've read, contributing to a growing library of user-generated content.
Recommendations: The platform uses user input to recommend books based on preferences, ratings, and favorite genres.
User Profiles: Users can create profiles to track books they've read, their ratings, and personal reviews.
Responsive Design: An intuitive, mobile-friendly design that ensures the application works seamlessly on any device.

This project demonstrates the ability to create a social platform with dynamic user-generated content and recommendation algorithms. Itâ€™s a great way to show your understanding of databases, RESTful APIs, user authentication, and front-end development with React.
